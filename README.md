#### Figure 2(b) 
Number of <i> D. albipictus</i>  occurrence records present in the database, grouped by year (bars) and separated into four periods of reporting interest (shaded)

#### Figure 4. 
Number of database records with associated hosts. <b>(a)</b> Number of records per host species, according to the average adult body mass per host, in kilograms. Common names of host examples are given for a range of masses (grey, pictorial). Host masses were obtained from the PanTHERIA database (Jones et al., 2009). <b>(b)</b> Frequency of records on cervids and livestock over time, for all data (solid lines, round points) and with moose hair loss records removed (dashed line, triangular points). Time periods have been grouped by characteristic peaks and troughs in record numbers in the dataset (as shown in <b>Figure 2(b)</b>). 

#### Figure 6 
Database records over time, grouped by decade, for <i>D. albipictus</i> split by <b>(a)</b> data type and <b>(b)</b> record basis. The relationships between these two types are shown in <b>(c)</b>.
